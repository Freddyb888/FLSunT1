I'm looking to fix some of the issues and help out the coders with the FLSun T1. I'm just fine tuning their own settings to my acceptable quality needs. This is purely a subjective modification and I will continue to work on it as time passes making improvemnets.

# NOTE
- If you don't know how to copy the printer.cfg file just copy all of the code and paste it your current printer.cfg under `Machine` in the web interface, `Save and Restart`

- If you like what I'm doing click on my profile and buy me a coffee or don't. Either way I'm going to keep doing what I do. 

Thank you!
